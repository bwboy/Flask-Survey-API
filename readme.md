# Flask RESTful Survey API

## To Do:

1. Validation of created/updated db objects
2. Add URI links for FK related objects in API output
3. Better exception and error handling
4. Have index show tables along with URI links
5. Make the survey list_q (question list) field be useful
6. Add security (prevent malicious input, user auth, etc)
7. Look into better ways to organize the code
